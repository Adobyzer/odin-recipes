    <h3> Steps </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
          For making your kefta and egg tagine, start by preparing the minced beef meatballs. Finely chop 1 onion, add the spices: 1 tsp of cumin, paprika, and ginger, along with parsley, and mix with the minced beef. Form your meatballs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put a few drops of olive oil in your tagine dish, heat it, and add your meatballs. Brown them for just a few minutes, then remove them from the dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the tagine, add a previously chopped onion, 1 tsp each of cumin, paprika, and ginger, crushed garlic, and quartered tomatoes. Cook this sauce for 15 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Return the minced beef meatballs to the tagine and sprinkle with olives. Cover and continue cooking over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can then crack your eggs into the dish, cover, and let them cook for another two to three minutes. Chop parsley to garnish your tagine.
        </li>
      </ol>

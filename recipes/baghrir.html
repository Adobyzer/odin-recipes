    <h3> Description </h3>
    <h3> "Pancakes, cooked on a griddle or baghrir, are a delicious, airy, and light treat that is easily prepared and is a culinary tradition in the Maghreb countries." </h3>

    <p>The thing with this dessert is that it pairs wonderfully with <a href="nahnah.html"> green tea</a>, and when mixed with buckwheat honey, it becomes a deadly combo.</p>

    <h3> Steps </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
          Take out the blender and pour all the ingredients except the baking powder. Mix for at least 5 minutes, until the batter becomes absolutely homogeneous, smooth, and lots of small bubbles appear on the surface. You can also perform this operation with a bowl and a mixer or blender; it takes the same amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, add the baking powder to the blender and mix for a few more minutes to ensure a well-blended mixture. The bubbles will have completely disappeared, but the batter will be smooth, a sign that it's almost ready.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the baghrir batter rest for a good fifteen minutes or more if you're patient: the pancakes with a thousand holes will be even better and lighter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a non-stick pan and heat it without adding any fat over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the pan is hot, pour the batter in the style of Breton pancakes and cook it for a few minutes. The pan-cooked baghrir only cooks on one side and is ready when it is covered with a thousand small holes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the pan-cooked baghrir with butter, sugar, honey, or even with a drizzle of olive oil for a savory version!
        </li>
      </ol>
